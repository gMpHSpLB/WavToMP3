1. This project encodes wave files of type 8 , 16 and 24 bits covering 
different Sample rates (mono and stereo). And uses VBR with quality = 3.

2. Limitation:
Unicode strings are not supported.
32 bits IEEE 754 float is not supported.

3. It uses pthread for parallel encoding.

4. Tested on platform: Ubuntu, Window (Binary from MinGW32 gcc-6.3.0).

5. Uses static libmp3lame.a to build executable.

6. Below is the code structure

src             - contains all modules related to application 
include         - contains Lame Library API
externallibs    - constains Lame static library.
main.cpp        - Create objects of different modules to read wave files from directory, enque them
                  invoke threads to encode them.
7. Usage:  <executable name> <Path of directory"
  example: wav2mp3.exe "C:\PersonalLocation\wavfiles"

8. See Makefile for building executable. 
Note: libmp3lame.a is required to keep under "externallibs" directory
